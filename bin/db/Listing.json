One can see in the eyes of the participants the positive influence of the game experience which is fundamentally about experiential learning.\"","strategyTxt":"Players simulate water levels along the river with cups filled with different amounts of water. Water is added or subtracted from the cups with sponges, and players are asked to predict the final level. Players earn game currency by reporting the water level, weather, and other real-time information about their local area. They can earn more by placing bets about future conditions. The farther out their predictions, and more accurate their guesses, the larger the reward. To help make more accurate guesses, players may also purchase information about what players upstream from them are reporting, or buy access to a computer model. In the end, the player who is best able to leverage this information into accurate predictions will be deemed the winner.","indexed":true,"archived":false,"bgImage":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/projects/dagozc5qlepbgqzhol8y","version":1599233704,"signature":"d638c31942d513e45bb843c9e12752f97a159500","width":6001,"height":1451,"format":"png","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1599233704/homepage-2.0/projects/dagozc5qlepbgqzhol8y.png","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1599233704/homepage-2.0/projects/dagozc5qlepbgqzhol8y.png"},"endYear":"","initiatives":[],"partners":[{"$oid":"5f4c51e8885c3c56ca643df4"}],"primaryImage":{"public_id":"homepage-2.0/projects/yrwumxqerhacpwxmh1pk","version":1599233704,"signature":"52d7651fe67ea5271afafdd3af3ffdec65011cae","width":720,"height":540,"format":"png","resource_type":"image","url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1599233704/homepage-2.0/projects/yrwumxqerhacpwxmh1pk.png","secure_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/engagement-lab-home/image/upload/v1599233704/homepage-2.0/projects/yrwumxqerhacpwxmh1pk.png"},"primaryImageDescription":"","projectLeads":["Eric Gordon"],"publications":[{"$oid":"591a0ffb924dcc26760e7254"}],"startYear":"2013","status":"Completed","teamMembers":[]}

Our approach was to work closely for 10 months with a community development corporation (CDC) in a Boston neighborhood to test the impact on the community of a series of tools for participatory planning – both digital and offline – all branded as part of a unified array of technologies: a Tech Habit@. Simultaneously, we conducted an organizational ethnography of the CDC to help them better understand their capacity in the area of communications and technology; we worked closely with youth affiliated with the organization to do outreach; and we helped the organization to create and deploy this cluster of tools according to their planning goals.\r\n\r\n**Our cluster of tools** – lightly branded with the Habit@ logo – included:\r\n\r\n#### TouchScreens\r\n\r\n_Two touch screen displays with apps co-designed by Engagement Lab and DSNI._\r\n\r\n#### Community PlanIt\r\n\r\n_Two implementations of Engagement Lab’s online game platform for participatory planning and community organizing.

Our approach was to work closely for 10 months with a community development corporation (CDC) in a Boston neighborhood to test the impact on the community of a series of tools for participatory planning – both digital and offline – all branded as part of a unified array of technologies: a Tech Habit@. Simultaneously, we conducted an organizational ethnography of the CDC to help them better understand their capacity in the area of communications and technology; we worked closely with youth affiliated with the organization to do outreach; and we helped the organization to create and deploy this cluster of tools according to their planning goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur cluster of tools\u003c/strong\u003e – lightly branded with the Habit@ logo – included:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"touchscreens\"\u003eTouchScreens\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTwo touch screen displays with apps co-designed by Engagement Lab and DSNI.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"community-planit\"\u003eCommunity PlanIt\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTwo implementations of Engagement Lab’s online game platform for participatory planning and community organizing.

conclusively shows that breastfeeding saves lives, prevents disease, and provides optimal infant nutrition.

In the year leading up to the 2018 Hackathon, the research team conducted applied qualitative and quantitative research with low-income women to understand the triumphs and challenges of feeding their babies. These digital stories and follow-up interviews resonated nationwide with women from diverse demographics and helped ensure that hackathon designs and ideas were inclusive. This initiative was developed with support by the MIT Center for Civic Media and made possible by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and Medela, as well as corporate sponsors. The Breast Pump Hackathon has been featured in Slate, Vogue, The Atlantic, and The Boston Globe.","strategyTxt":"To address these issues, the Hackathon included a variety of events and spaces; it was a design sprint for designers, engineers, parents, and health care providers. The Make Family Leave Not Suck Policy Summit acted as a convening for national thought leaders on paid family leave policy. The Innovators Gallery was an exhibitor space with 25 top breastfeeding tech companies such as Medela and EvenFlo. There was also an art exhibition showcasing artwork related to breastfeeding and pumping. And perhaps most importantly, there was the Baby Village, a space for babies and parents to chill and get massages. There was also a “Community Innovation Accelerator” to cultivate four community-based teams to take a leadership role at the hackathon. Participants in the accelerator represent people who have not traditionally been involved in hackathons but who were already talented innovators and advocates for low-income families in their communities. The 2018 Hackathon also recognized that the future is intersectional. Working with equity expert Jennifer Roberts and the Office of Diversity and Student Support at the Media Lab, Historically Black Colleges and Universities helped support the participation of undergraduate students in the hackathon and policy summit.\r\nThere was also a  “Community Innovation Accelerator” to cultivate four community-based teams to take a leadership role at the hackathon.

That’s why we created a platform that combines digital literacy learning, user generated content, and game-based structures that’s easy to set-up, fun to play, and educationally powerful.\r\n\r\nWe created Emerging Citizens in order to understand how game based playful experiences can fill this gap.\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n\r\n## What is Emerging Citizens?\r\nEmerging Citizens is a suite of digital multiplayer party games that teach students how to critique and create civic media. Paul Mihailidis, Associate Professor, and Co-Director of the Engagement Lab @ Emerson College, conducted a multi-year research project exploring how youth use social media to engage in civic life. He found that youth engage in social networking and cultural sharing in dynamic ways, but have trouble recognizing how their digital applications provide productive connectivity, vibrant communication, and diverse information consumption in daily life. Therefore, we created a platform that combines digital literacy learning and user-generated content with game-based structures that are easy to set up, fun to play, and educationally powerful.You can read more about Emerging Citizens here. \r\n\r\n## What is Wikigeeks?\r\nWikiGeeks is a real-time race played within Wikipedia.org that gives players a topic, asks them to choose a starting page, and then race to be the first player to reach a revealed Wikipedia page using only hyperlinks. Learn more about Wikigeeks  here.\r\n\r\n## What is Hashtag You’re It? \r\nHashtag You’re It is a Twitter-based bluffing game where players read real tweets with hidden hashtags, submit their own hashtag to fool other players, and then attempt to guess the real hashtag themselves without getting tricked. Learn more about Hashtag You’re It here.\r\n\r\n## What is Wait Wait Don’t Meme Me? \r\nWait Wait Don’t Meme Me! is a meme-creation voting game that gives players a topic, asks them to make a meme about that topic, and then vote on which player’s meme best matches a revealed description. Learn more about Wait Wait Don’t Meme Me here.\r\n\r\n## What is a “content category”? \r\nWithin Emerging Citizens, there are different content categories. For example, some content categories are: US Politics, Migration and Science \u0026 Technology. Each category is tied to one or more lesson plans that are specific to a certain game in the Emerging Citizens Suite.\r\n\r\n## What is the difference between our learning guide and a lesson plan? \r\nA learning guide is a document that educators can use to familiarize themselves with one of the games included in the Emerging Citizens suite. There are three learning guides total, with one for each game. \r\nLesson plans are tied to content categories. For example, there is one lesson plan for US Politics for Hashtag you’re it, another lesson plan for Wikigeeks, and another lesson plan for US Politics for Wait, Wait Don’t Meme Me! They all have related content, but different lesson plans. There also may be more than one lesson plan per game for the same category.  \r\n\r\n## When will lesson plans be available? \r\nHang tight! Our learning plans will be available January 2017. \r\n\r\n## What is a lesson plan? \r\nA lesson plan is a document that uses one specific content category for learning material, but can be applied to one or more games within the Emerging Citizens suite. Educators can reference lesson plans to help guide classroom activities and discussions. \r\n\r\n## How do I use a lesson plan? \r\nEach lesson plan has a specified topic and game that complements the content of the lesson. After picking a lesson plan, choose the game included in the lesson and select the appropriate topic(s) before you launch the game. \r\n\r\n## Is there a way to use my own lesson plans? \r\nIf you are interested in using your own lesson plans with Emerging Citizens, please submit your ideas in this typeform. We think it’s very important for teachers to share their ideas with other educators, so we are working to create a library of user-created lessons. \r\n\r\n\r\n## What devices are supported?\r\nAs a web-based game, Emerging Citizens has been developed to play on a range of mobile devices and desktop computers.\r\n\u0009\u0009iOS: iOS7+ (iPhone 4/iPad 2 or later)\r\n\u0009\u0009Android: Ice Cream Sandwich+ (Generally devices made in 2011 or later)\r\n\u0009\u0009Windows/Mac (Browser): Internet Explorer 10+/Safari 5.1+/Chrome\r\n_We recommend playing Emerging Citizens with the most up-to-date version of IE/Safari/Chrome for the best experience._\r\n\r\n## What happens if a player gets disconnected? \r\n- If a player becomes disconnected from a game before it starts, they must join the lobby again.\r\n- If a player becomes disconnected from a game after it starts, they may refresh the page on their device to reconnect.

We think working with data should be more fun! Take a look at our activity guides for hands-on approaches to analyzing your data using these tools. Activity guides combined with fun data sets like music lyrics can help you take a playful approach to finding stories in your data. Don't you want to know \u0026quot;what the fudge\u0026quot; is going on with your CSV file?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Doing One Thing Well\r\nThere are tons of tools for working with data; many so complex they are intimidating to even start with. We've built each DataBasic tool to focus on doing one thing well, so you know exactly what each can be used for. This lets us concentrate on making that one thing both simple and powerful.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Focused on Learning\r\nSometimes faster isn't better. If you really want to learn how to work with data to find stories to tell, you'll need to use tools that do more than just give you a chart as quickly as possible. That's why we've built DataBasic with learners in mind. Don't know what some technical word means? Hover over it to see a quick definition. Not sure how to use a tool? Try some of the fun sample data like music lyrics and UFO sightings we've included to get started.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fitting in to Your Pipeline\r\nWorking with data online always involves using a mishmash of tools.

In light of the recent humanitarian crisis in Syria and its impact on communities across the globe, this project will use the case of migration to explore how media frames issues, sets public agendas, and engages in cultural meaning-making in the digital public sphere.  Public bodies and citizens affected by the migration crisis are using connective platforms, social networks and digital technologies to consume, produce, express and share information in ever more open, diverse, and collaborative ways. Media literacy thus becomes central to how citizens demand diverse and balanced media coverage of issues, create and share their own narratives about issues of importance to them, and interact with policy makers and government officials about how such issues impact contemporary society.  This project, in partnership with the IFA (Institut Für Auslandsbeziehungen), will examine how digital media is effectively used as a tool to share and repurpose information, cultivate cultural meaning-making and inspire social action.  The outcome will be a report on media literacy, public policy and migration, and a robust online resource that synthesizes a set of media literacy recommendations for those involved with developing constructive online messaging campaigns for and by communities impacted by migration. The findings of the research will be shared at a public workshop designed in coordination with the Salzburg Academy on Media and Global Change.  Banner Image: Mare Nostrum, 2014.

The name’s genealogy is generally considered to be a reference to the city or county of Limerick, Ireland. The early nineteenth century brief songs were  sung at convivial gatherings in the city of Limerick in Ireland. These verses dealt with with the adventures of inhabitants of various Irish towns, and the chorus extended the invitation: “Will you come up to Limerick?” Limericks often have bawdy, pornographic and vulgar subject matter which makes them perfect for contemporary American politics.\nWant to write your own?

The name’s genealogy is generally considered to be a reference to the city or county of Limerick, Ireland. The early nineteenth century brief songs were  sung at convivial gatherings in the city of Limerick in Ireland. These verses dealt with with the adventures of inhabitants of various Irish towns, and the chorus extended the invitation: “Will you come up to Limerick?” Limericks often have bawdy, pornographic and vulgar subject matter which makes them perfect for contemporary American politics.\r\nWant to write your own?

In the second part of the game, they can act as themselves, and they are asked to prioritize values for the planning process. The players' comments and decisions are shared with decision-makers in the community to help with the development of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n**Context**\r\n\r\nSince 1990, Chinatown, a 46-acre neighborhood in Boston has been engaged in several master-planning processes to determine the future growth pattern of the neighborhood. Located in downtown Boston, Chinatown has presented a challenging context for planning: as an ethnically and socio-economically diverse area in the shadow of the rapidly gentrifying financial and theater districts, the neighborood has had to embrace gentrification while struggling to maintain its unique identity both as a Chinese community and as a welcoming  place for new immigrants. Over the course of the last several decades, the Chinatown community has engaged in countless community meetings meant to engage the residents of the neighborhood in the decision-making process. Every ten years, the process starts again, so that the community may assess past changes and plan for the future. Collection of community input for the most recently completed 2010 master plan was facilitated by five public meetings between July 2009 and June 2010.\r\n\r\nThe resulting plan was meant to guide conversation for the coming decade. In addition to the traditional mechanism of engaging the community in town-hall style meetings, Participatory Chinatown was introduced into the process, in order to create better learning and increase diversity of participants.\r\n\r\n**The Event**\r\n\r\nThe game launched on the eventing of 3 may 2010 in a large community room in Boston's Chinatown, where 48 people from the community gatheresd to play. The conversation and digital interactions taking place at communal play tables was the focal point of each player's experience. In addition to the physical proximity of players sharing a table, each table represented a multi-player game where players could interact in a shared virtual environment. The meeting was facilitated in such a way that the small group interactions at the tables and in the virtual Chinatown were periodically shared with the front of the room. This was meant to produce a dynamic environment that could extend the virtual game environment experience into the physical room. To address Chinatown's diverse language needs, the game was playable in either English or Chinese, and a translator was present throughout the meeting.","html":"\u003cp\u003eParticipatory Chinatown is a multiplayer game designed to be played in a large physical space.

As of 2015, 20% of all global children-under-five mortality from diarrhea or pneumonia occurs in India. Handwashing with soap and improved sanitation are effective measures for reducing illness and death from diarrheal diseases and acute respiratory infections.\r\n\r\nHygiene with Chhota Bheem is centered around characters from Chhota Bheem, a popular children’s television show in India, working to defeat an evil Germ Wizard who has been spreading germs and filth through their village, Dholakpur. In each lesson, children watch narrated stories involving Chhota Bheem, play games and activities related to the stories, and take part in weekly challenges, such as drawing pictures of the important handwashing times and showing them to family, to defeat the Germ Wizard from the stories. Learning goals are also reinforced through a digital Android game.\r\n\r\nThe curriculum teaches children how to use a squat toilet and wash hands with soap, when it is important to wash hands with soap in order to prevent germ transfer, why handwashing and toilet use are important for individual and community health, and how to convince friends and family to practice healthy hygiene and sanitation. It incorporates learning about changes at the individual level that children are more able to implement, such as making soapy water bottles to conserve water and soap or handwashing with wood ash when soap is not readily available. \r\n\r\nHygiene with Chhota Bheem was developed in partnership with [Green Gold Animation](http://www.greengold.tv/), the [Indian Red Cross Society](http://www.indianredcross.org/), the [Mary Anne Charity Trust](http://www.mactindia.org/), [Hygiene Heroes](http://hygieneheroes.berkeley.edu/), and a Working Group of NGOs and civil society groups dedicated to improving sanitation and hygiene in Tamil Nadu.
