The majority of Americans do not trust the information they get from news sources and they generally believe the media is doing a poor job separating fact and opinion. News organizations have long been in the business of reporting on people. As trust in journalism continues to decline, there is real need for organizations to open up to their audiences and build capacity to report with people. Our Trust in the News initiative is focused on building capacity of news organizations, big and small, to better engage audiences in different and more relevant stories. This means creating more engaging content, but it also means creating relationships between publics and news organizations that are built on trust and negotiation. "}
